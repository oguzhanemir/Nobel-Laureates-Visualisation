This is a D3.js combined column and dot plot visualization to compare age and gender of Nobel Prize winners over the years.

I have replaced the dots of the plot by bars vertically aligned. Their height describes the age, higher the bar older the laureate at the time of their winning.

The genders are represented by color: grey for men and red for women. The color choice aims to highlight women's status versus men. There is an increase over time but certainly nothing approaching equality of outcome.

There is also signficant difference among distinct disciplines. For instance, pysics seems to have been male dominated until very recently. The red bar on the left-most side is the extraordinary mother of modern physics: Mrs. Marie Cuire

On some years bars overlap and become darker. That means we have more than one winner at that year and category.
